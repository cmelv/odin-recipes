    <h3>Don't call the local takeaway – impress friends and family by cooking this fragrant and creamy Thai green chicken curry. It's easy and quick to make</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Thai green curry paste (according to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soft dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1–2 thick stalks lemongrass, fat ends bashed with a rolling pin (optional)</li>
        <li>750g/1½lb skinless, boneless chicken chicken breast, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>6–8 kaffir lime leaves, torn into pieces (if unavailable, use the grated zest of 1 lime)</li>
        <li>400ml tin coconut milk</li>
        <li>good shake of Thai fish sauce or light soy sauce</li>
        <li>large handful of coriander, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>½–1 lime, juice only</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan. Add the green curry paste and sugar and cook over a fairly high heat for about a minute, stirring with the lemongrass, if using.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat slightly and stir in the chicken pieces and lime leaves or zest until coated in the paste.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk, fish sauce or soy sauce and bring to a simmer, cooking for 25–30 minutes until thickened slightly. Stir in the coriander and lime juice. Check for seasoning, adding more fish sauce or soy sauce if needed.</li>
        <li>The curry is now best left to sit for a few minutes so the sauce becomes creamier. You will also taste the true flavours of the curry paste ingredients when it's slightly cooler. Serve with lots of fragrant Thai jasmine rice.</li>
       
    </ol>
