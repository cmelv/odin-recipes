    <h3>You can rustle up these crispy bites with a few storecupboard ingredients - sparkling water is the key to a really light batter</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        
        <li>1 large onion, cut into 1cm slices, rings separated</li>
        <li>groundnut oil, for deep frying</li>
        <li>150g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>180ml sparkling water</li>
        

    </ul>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Use a fork to steady your onion. Slice the onion into rings about 1cm wide. Remove the skin and separate the rings.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil to 180C in a heavy-based pan â€“ it should be no more than 1/ 3 full.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile put the flour and sparkling water in a bowl and season generously. Whisk together to form a batter.</li>
        <li>Coat a small batch of onion rings in batter. Carefully lower into the hot oil and deep-fry until crisp and golden, about 2 - 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a piece of kitchen towel to drain. Repeat with the remaining onion and batter.</li>
